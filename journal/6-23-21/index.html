    A good game utilizes an addicting, simple gameplay loop. 
    A better game takes place on the ocean. But what ruins it all is involving Morse code;
    what kind of stupid game involves some esoteric radio language used by lonesome,
    probably deranged lighthouse operators and rather thick-witted secret op organizations?
    Well, I didn’t think of that question before developing this game,
    so you’ll just have to bare through the horridness if you play it.
    However, the rule: you can’t leave a negative review, because I warned you,
    and it’d hurt my feelings <i>(and income)</i>. This is legally binding.
