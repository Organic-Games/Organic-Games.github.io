      Haha! You have no other choice but to buy my game because of my amazing marketing tactics. It's not even that good of a game! You've been fooled! Tricked! Hoodwinked!
      Bamboozled! Deceived! Duped! Swindled! Misleaded! Conned!

      <i>"You were the only applicant. You have been accepted. Please report to Locke Key by Monday."</i><br>
      Take the role of a lighthouse operator, and use your spacebar to send Morse code messages to ships in the sea. Be quick and keep your boss satisfied, until his highly expensive cruise ship starts to sink! Can you save him and the passengers with your Morse code clicker?<br><br>
      - 5 levels, Monday through Friday<br>
      - An endless mode after completing Friday<br>
      - An easy mode for the casuals<br>
      - Leaderboards and trophies (GameJolt and Mac App Store versions only)<br>
      - Somewhat of a storyline<br>
